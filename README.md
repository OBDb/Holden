## About Holden

Holden was an Australian automobile manufacturer and importer that operated from 1856 to 2020. Originally established as a saddlery business, Holden evolved to become Australia's own car manufacturer and a subsidiary of General Motors.

## Generations

- **Pre-GM Era (1856-1931)**: Founded as a saddlery manufacturer by James Alexander Holden in Adelaide, South Australia. The company gradually transitioned to automobile body building in the early 20th century, producing bodies for chassis imported from overseas manufacturers.

- **GM-Holden Era (1931-2017)**: General Motors purchased Holden in 1931, forming General Motors-Holden. In 1948, Holden produced Australia's first mass-produced car, the Holden 48-215 (commonly known as the FX). Throughout this period, Holden produced iconic Australian vehicles including the Kingswood, Torana, Monaro, and Commodore, establishing itself as a cultural icon in Australia.

- **Import-Only Era (2017-2020)**: In 2017, Holden ceased local manufacturing in Australia, transitioning to an import-only business model. The company imported and rebadged vehicles from other GM brands, primarily from Europe and Asia.

- **Legacy Era (2020-present)**: In February 2020, General Motors announced the retirement of the Holden brand, with operations ceasing by the end of 2020. GM continues to provide service and parts support for existing Holden vehicles through 2032.
